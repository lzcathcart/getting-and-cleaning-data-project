CODEBOOK
Describes the variables, data, and how the data was cleaned.

VARIABLES
Contains 180 objects/rows and 68 variables/columns.
The only variables that were kept in the data set were from mean and standard deviations.

mean() = mean value
std() = standard deviation

ROWS
Have been averaged for each subject and activity.

COLUMNS
Subject and label columns have been organized numerically and alphabetically.  

SUBJECT
Organized from 1 to 30 numerically.

LABEL
This column is for the activity performed with it's corresponding number. 

1.WALKING
2.WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3.WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4.SITTING
5.STANDING
6.LAYING
